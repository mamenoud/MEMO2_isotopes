# MEMO2_isotopes
Measured CH4 isotopic signatures by the Innovative Training Network (ITN) MEMO2 (https://h2020-memo2.eu)

Description:
---------------------
d13C-CH4, and dD-CH4 signatures of various CH4 emission sources. Air samples were collected around the sources during mobile measurements campaigns performed within the MEMO2 ITN. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 re-search and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 722479.

Start: 23/11/2017 
End: 05/03/2020

Measurement methods:
---------------------
Samples were taken in flexi foil bags, Tedlar bags, glass flasks or steel canisters. They were sent in either these two labs:
- Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Reasearch Utrecht (IMAU), at Utrecht University for d13C and dD -CH4 measurements. Contact: T.Roeckmann@uu.nl
- Earth science department of the Royal Holloway University of London (RHUL) for d13C-CH4 measurements. Contact: D.Lowry@rhul.ac.uk

Variables:
---------------------
*Source ID* Unique identifier
*Date* dd/mm/yyyy
*Time (UTC)*
*Affiliation* MEMO2 beneficiaries involved in the data collection and processing
*SNAP deduced/certain* emission category following the Selected Nomenclature for Air Pollution (EEA (European Environment Agency) (Feb. 2000). EMEP/CORINAIR Atmospheric emission inventory guidebook - Second edition 1999. Output from Annual Management Plan, p. 1750.) The "deduced" sources weere categorized afterwards based on the context and isotopic results, whereas the "certain" sources are when the emissions of this location were known beforehand
*NFR code* emission categories used in UK inventories (https://naei.beis.gov.uk/glossary?view=nfr)
Latitude & Longitude -> in decimals

Wind (m/s) -> Wind velocity
Met. Location	-> Location of the meteorological station
Source type	-> Where the emission comes from (or assumed)

n d13C -> Number of samples of the same source used for d13C source signature
Source d13C VPDB [‰]/+-	-> Calculated source d13C against international reference material Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite, and associated uncertainty
r2 d13C	-> Person's r2 coefficient of the d13C regression line
x(CH4) excess d13C [ppb]/+-	-> Difference between maximum and minimum mole fractions in the samples used for d13C source signature, and associated uncertainty
n dD -> Number of samples of the same source used for dD source signature
Source dD SMOW [‰]/+-	-> Calculated source dD against international reference material Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, and associated uncertainty
r2 dD	-> Person's r2 coefficient of the dD regression line
x(CH4) excess dD [ppb]/+-	-> Difference between maximum and minimum mole fractions in the samples used for dD source signature, and associated uncertainty
Regression method -> Mass balance method and linear fit used to derive the source signature(s). ODR=Orthogonal distance regression, BCES=Bivariate Correlated Errors and intrinsic Scatter
